    <p class="username">Hello my name is Frank Dowdy and this is my website</p>
    <p>
      This website is a response to Douglas Rushkoff who thought that the way
      big tech companies mediate the communication between people is bad and he
      wished that the world could go back to the days before Web 2.0. Rushkoff
      said that learning HTML is not that difficult so I spent an afternoon
      learning how to get a site live. The site will probably change over time
      but I got my own text online in less than a day without Twitter or Meta
      being involved.
