      Hello my name is not Frank Dowdy but there is already a Michael Trent
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is a response to Douglas Rushkoff's comments on the sinister
      nature of the way big tech companies mediate the communication between
      people. Rushkoff though something was lost when the internet became the
      World Wide Web. He thought easier didn't mean better. 
    <p>
    </p>
      Learning HTML turned out not to be that difficult (as Rushkoff said) and I spent an
      afternoon getting this site live. The site will probably change
      over time but I got my own text online in less than a day without Twitter
      or Facebook being involved.
