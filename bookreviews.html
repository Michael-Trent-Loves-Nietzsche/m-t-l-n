    <h2>Three Books About Practical Maths</h2>
    <h3>How To Lie With Statistics</h3>
    <p>
      Explains all the ways used to cynically or incompetently use numbers and
      data to... well... lie. Thorough and exlpains things simply. Probably best
      paired with How to make the world add up so you don’t get too downhearted
      about things. Remember, Tim Harford’s adage is true: it’s easy to lie with
      statistics but even easier to lie without them.
    </p>
    <h3>How To Make The World Add Up</h3>
    <p>
      A good book for sure but one you can miss if you’re already familiar with
      Tim Harford’s work on Radio 4 and his podcasts. This explains how numbers
      can be used to make sense of current events and politics.
    </p>
    <h3>Fooled By Randomness</h3>
    <p>
      The third in the trio I’d recommend. This is more of a philosophical look
      but goes into the maths just enough for my liking. Does what it says on
      the tin and if like me you’re thinking “does this need to be this long to
      get the point across” the answer is maybe not but still enjoyable all the
      way though.
    </p>
    <h2>Present Shock (Douglas Rushkoff)</h2>
    <p>
      This is a book I would actually not recommend. I didn’t manage to finish
      it and I’m probably not going to. I do think there is a lot of value in
      the what Rushkoff says in interviews and on his podcast (Team Human) but
      his writing style didn’t give the same energy. Also, I think it’s worth
      pointing out that Rushkoff is a cultural critic and not a cut and dried
      historian or sociologist so I would say his ideas are at best ‘something
      to think about’ and should not be taken as facts.
