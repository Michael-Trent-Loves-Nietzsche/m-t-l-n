    <h1>What's The Probility Of Event With Multiple Tries?</h1>
    <p>
      For example, the chance of rolling a 6 one a D6 is 0.167 so if you roll 4
      times the chance of rolling at least one 6 is 51.8%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or a coin has a 50:50 chance of landing a head and with 3 tosses there's
      an 87.5% chance of getting a head
