    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hello there. My name in not really Frank Dowdy but there is already a
      Michael Trent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the idea of making a website when I saw an interview Douglas
      Rushkoff did where he said that learning HTML is easy and something people
      should try if they want to get a better understanding of digital media.
      Rushkoff is critical of the way big tech companies mediate communication
      between people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning HTML turned out not to be that difficult and I spent an afternoon
      getting this site live. The site will probably change over time but I got
      my own text online in less than a day without Twitter or Facebook being
      involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of the website is based on Cliff Stoll's kleinbottle.com. Seeing
      that website gave me the idea of keeping things simple (although if I
      learn more CSS I may make changes over time). I should probably also
      mention the YouTuber Matt Parker who's enthusiasm and DIY attitiute made
      me believe I could learn to code (I started on Python a little while ago).
    </p>
    <p>
      For anyone interested in Rushkoff's ideas, his book 'Program or be
      Programmed' goes into more detail about his thoughts on coding and he has
      many videos on the topic on YouTube. He thought something was lost when
      the internet became the World Wide Web.
