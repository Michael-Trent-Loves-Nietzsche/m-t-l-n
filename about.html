    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hello there. My name in not really Frank Dowdy but there is already a
      Michael Trent.

    <p>
      The idea to make this website came from an interview I saw with media
      critic Douglas Rushkoff (which I can no longer find on YouTube). In the
      interview he explained that he thought learning HTML was fairly easy and
      something people should try if they want to get a better understanding of
      digital media. Rushkoff is critical of the way big tech companies mediate
      communication between people and often talks fondly about the old
      text-only internet.
    </p>

      Learning HTML turned out not to be that difficult and I spent an afternoon
      getting this site live. The site will probably change over time but I got
      my own text online in less than a day without Twitter or Facebook being
      involved.

      The look of the website is based on Cliff Stoll's kleinbottle.com which
      keeps the late 90's aesthetic (though for differnt reasons; Stoll made his
      website in the 90's and didn't want to update it).
