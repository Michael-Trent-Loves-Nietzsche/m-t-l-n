    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hello there. My name in not really Frank Dowdy but there is already a
      Michael Trent.

    <p>
      The idea to make this website came from an interview I saw with media
      critic Douglas Rushkoff (which I can no longer find on YouTube). In the
      interview he explained that he thought learning HTML was fairly easy and
      something people should try if they want to get a better understanding of
      digital media. Rushkoff is critical of the way big tech companies mediate
      communication between people and often talks fondly about the old
      text-only internet.
    </p>

      Learning HTML turned out not to be that difficult and I spent an afternoon
      getting this site live. The site will probably change over time but I got
      my own text online in less than a day without Twitter or Facebook being
      involved.

      The look of the website is based on Cliff Stoll's kleinbottle.com which
      keeps the late 90's aesthetic (though for differnt reasons; Stoll made his
      website in the 90's and didn't want to update it).
    </p>

      For anyone interested in Rushkoff's ideas, his book 'Program or be
      Programmed' goes into more detail about his thoughts on coding and he has
      many videos on the topic on YouTube. He thought something was lost when
      the internet became the World Wide Web.
