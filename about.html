    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hello there. My name in not really Frank Dowdy but there is already a
      Michael Trent.

    <p>
      I set up this webste because I wanted to make something one weekend and I
      thought about what Douglas Rushkoff said in an interview about HTML not
      being difficult to learn. Rushkoff is also critical of the way big tech
      companies mediate the communication between people. He thought something
      was lost when the internet became the World Wide Web. He thought easier
      didn't mean better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning HTML turned out not to be that difficult and I spent an afternoon
      getting this site live. The site will probably change over time but I got
      my own text online in less than a day without Twitter or Facebook being
      involved.
