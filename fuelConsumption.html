    <h1>What's Your Car's Fuel Consumption?</h1>
    <p>To work out your car's fuel consumption in miles per gallon:</p>
    <p>
      1. Reset you car's trip button for the odometer (distance-meter) when you
      next fill up your car
    </p>
    <p>2. Check the reading on the odometer next time you fill your car up</p>
    <p>3. Find out how much fuel you added to your car in litres</p>
    <p>4. Input the values into this webpage</p>

    <button onclick="myFunction1()">How many miles have you travelled?</button>
    <button onclick="myFunction2()">
      How many litres of fuel did you add to you car?
    </button>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      function myFunction1() {
        let milesTravelled = prompt(
          "Please enter the distance travelled in your car in miles.",
          "100"
        );

        if (milesTravelled != null) kmTravelled = milesTravelled * 1.609;

        let litresUsed = prompt(
          "How many litres of fuel did you add to you car?",
          "10"
        );

        if (litresUsed != null) gallonsUsed = litresUsed * 0.22;
        milesPerGallon = milesTravelled / gallonsUsed;
        {
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
            "Your fuel consumption is " +
            Math.round(milesPerGallon) +
            " miles per gallon";
