    <h1>Dice Game: Three Dice Dutch</h1>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>
      The rules of Three Dice Dutch are that a D4, a D6 and a D20 are all rolled
      up to three times. The punter is trying to roll a total of 23 or higher in
      each turn and wins if they do. Otherwise, the house wins. The bet is an
      even bet where a punter gets their initial stake plus their stake again if
      they win (i.e. 1:1 odds).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that each turn of up to three rolls is separate. If a
      score of 23 or over is rolled a new round would begin.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to devise a game to play with dice based on the Chevalier de
      Mere's dice game using some dice that my sister got me for Christmas 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier de Mere figured out though practical experimentation that
      you are more likely to roll a six throwing a fair D6 up to four times than
      you are to roll double-six rolling two fair D6 dice up to 24 times.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used Microsoft Excel to simulate the chance of getting some different
      totals with different dice. I then calculated the chance of getting a
      certain total or higher after one to five rolls. After a few trials with
      my brother I decided Three Dice Dutch was the best variation. The name
      came a bit later.
    </p>
    <h2>Probability</h2>
    <p>
      With an evens bet the punter will win 48.8% of the time and the house will
      win 51.2% of the time. On average the punter will lose £0.24 per £10 bet.
      Due to random variation some players will win especially in the short.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after 1,000 bets, 95% of the time a punter will lose between £45
      and £435 (if they stick to £10 bets). This means fewer than one in twenty
      players would have made any money if they were rich and foolish enough to
      make 1,000 £10 bets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also means over a long enough timescale, the house would be almost
      guaranteed to make money. This is how casinos make money. They need a lot
      of tables and slot machines though to protect themselves from times when
      random chance means the punters win and they lose money.
    </p>
    <h2>Table 1</h2>

    <p>
      Table 1 shows how I figured out the probabilities. The Amt column shows
      the number of times each total came up in 500,000 simulations on Excel.
      You could use the table to see other possible variations. For example the
      house could get a better advantage by betting on a player rolling 18 or
      higher in just one roll or could give 2:1 odds on rolling 25 or higher in
      up to three rolls.
