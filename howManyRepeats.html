      How many times do you have to repeat an event to be likely to get the
      outcome you want?
    </h1>
    <p>
      For example, if there's a 1 in 36 chance of rolling a double six on two
      fair dice and you want to be 95% sure of getting that outcome you have to
      roll the dice 107 times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you only wanted to be 70% sure of getting double six you'd only
      need to roll the dice 43 times.
