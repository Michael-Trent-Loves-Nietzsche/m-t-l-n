    <h3>The Big Moon: Somerset House 18-Jul-24</h3>
    <p>
      The most relaxed gig I've ever been to. Somerset House is a grand old
      house built in 1796 and the gig took place in the huge courtyard. The
      weather was brilliant so even though the gig was in the evening, it was
      still T-shirt temperature. The Big Moon don't have any bad songs and I was
      glad to hear Bonfire and Ladye Bay. I loved the Fat Boy Slim cover also,
      what a treat to hear Praise You!
