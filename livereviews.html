    <h1>Live Reviews</h1>
    <p>
      This page is where I am uploading reviews of live events I have attended
    </p>
    <h3>The Big Moon: Somerset House 18-Jul-24</h3>
    <p>
      The most relaxed gig I've ever been to. Somerset House is a grand old
      house built in 1796 and the gig took place in the huge courtyard. The
      weather was brilliant so even though the gig was in the evening, it was
      still T-shirt temperature. The Big Moon don't have any bad songs and I was
      glad to hear Bonfire and Ladye Bay. I loved the Fat Boy Slim cover also,
      what a treat to hear Praise You!
    </p>

    <h3>Pear: Edinburgh Fringe 10-Jul-24</h3>
    <p>
      Very very very funny. Live sketch comedy from 6'7" twins who didn't let
      the audience forget that they were very tall and very identical. Great
      interaction with the audience. Just enough shocking humour to go with the
      silly stuff.

    <h3>Eric Rushton: Edinburgh Fringe 10-Jul-24</h3>
    <p>
      Funny and relatable. Check YouTube for his reaction to a guy in the front
      row leaving just before the end at the performance I was at. Snd it's good
      to see a comedian with a maths degree.

    <h3>
      The Importance of Being Ernest: Grosvenor Park Open Air Theatre 01-Sep-24
    </h3>
    <p>
      Probably one of the best plays ever written. This performance featured
      some well done physical comedy as well as fine acting. The small space was
      used very effectively and the close proximity of the audience was not
      wasted (there was more than a little pointing out audience members; very
      funny if you happened to be there). I also liked the actors taking turns
      on different instruments to provide live backing music.
