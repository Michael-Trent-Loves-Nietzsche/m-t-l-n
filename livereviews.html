      This page is where I am uploading reviews of live events I have attended
    </p>
    <h2>The Big Moon: Somerset House 18-Jul-24</h2>
    <p>
      10/10 would recommend. The most relaxed gig I've ever been to. The Big
      Moon Don't have any bad songs and I loved the Fat Boy Slim cover!
